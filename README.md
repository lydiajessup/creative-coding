# creative-coding
Assignments from Introduction to Computational Media 2018

A few notes:
- the ICM Madness code was made collaboratively with two other classmates, Rachel and Manu, all others are my own
- I have included a few other p5.js sketches that I made in other classes (physical computing and visual language) but were related to this class material
